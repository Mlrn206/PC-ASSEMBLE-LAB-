On 30.10.2023, we as group 11 have a hands-on session to do assemble and reassemble a PC. After the guidance of the assistant, we are able to assemble and reassemble the PC successfully.
For me, it was my first time to see how a PC is built up. At the same time, I have learnt and remember the step of assemble and reassemble a PC. It was really fantastic to do this task since I never expect I will make it in one day. 

# REFLECTIONS ðŸŒŸ
#### Throughout this session, I learnt to be more careful and try my best to avoid carelessness during assembling a PC. Besides, my suggestion about the improvement is try to make more interesting hands-on session to students so that they will not feel boring with the course. 
It will not only enhance the passion but also interest too. As the saying goes, kill one bird with two stones. Lastly, it was worth for me to learn about it.
